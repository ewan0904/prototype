        **What is it?**  
        The amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) a recipe is responsible for ‚Äì mainly **CO‚ÇÇ, methane,**  
        and **nitrous oxide** ‚Äì all rolled into one number that tells us how much the meal warms the planet.

        **How do we measure it?**  
        Every gas is converted into the warming power of CO‚ÇÇ and added up, so we get a single value in  
        **kilograms of CO‚ÇÇ-equivalents (kg CO‚ÇÇ-eq)** per recipe.

        **Why does it matter for food?**  
        - Agriculture makes up ~33 % of global GHGs, which represents a significant influence to global warming.  
        - Seeing the number of a recipe helps us understand how much CO‚ÇÇ-equivalents are likely emitted and rank the recipes appropriately.

        **Threshold**  
        - A safe operating threshold is about **2.44 kg of CO‚ÇÇ-equivalents** per day.
        - This threshold represents a daily carbon budget per person. If everyone in the world kept their emissions within this limit, 
        it would keep total global carbon emissions within the remaining carbon budget ‚Äî helping to limit global warming to no more than **2¬∞C**,

        We express all ozone-eating chemicals (old fridges, certain crop-cooling agents, etc.) as  
        **kilograms of CFC-11-equivalents (kg CFC-11-eq)**.

        **Why does it matter for food?**

        **How do we measure it?**  
        Land use impact is translated into a dimensionless score in "pt" (points).
        These points express the relative environmental damage from land use (e.g. impacts on biodiversity, soil quality, and ecosystem services).
        The higher the points, the greater the environmental impact associated with land use - indicating more pressure on ecosystems, biodiversity, and natural resources.

        **Why does it matter for food?**

        - Helps us spot recipes that spare forests and wildlife corridors.

                ### ü©∫ Health Scoring System

                In this system, each recipe is assessed using **25 nutritional metrics**:
                - **7 macronutrients** (e.g. protein, fat, carbs)
                - **7 minerals** (e.g. calcium, iron, zinc)
                - **11 vitamins** (e.g. vitamin A, D, B12)

                Each of these nutrients is given a **weight** to indicate how important it is in the overall health score.

                ---

                #### ‚öôÔ∏è How Nutritional Scoring Works

                - **Each nutrient's score** is based on how closely the amount in the recipe aligns with recommended daily intake values.
                - Some nutrients also have **upper limits** ‚Äì if a recipe exceeds those, the score drops accordingly.
                - If a recipe‚Äôs value is **far from the recommended range**, it will negatively affect the score.
                - But ‚Äî each nutrient only affects the score **as much as its weight allows**.

                For example:  
                If you give **calcium** a low weight, even if a recipe has too much or too little, it won‚Äôt drag the overall score down much. But if you give it high importance, it has more influence.

                > *Note: The recommended daily intake and limits are divided by the number of preferred meals.*

                ---

                ### üåç Environmental Scoring System

                Environmental metrics evaluate the **ecological impact** of recipes, using standardized indicators (e.g. CO‚ÇÇ emissions, land use, water use).

                Each environmental metric has a:
                - **Threshold** (a benchmark for acceptable impact)
                - Or a **median value** used for comparison

                The closer a recipe stays **within these bounds**, the better its environmental score.  
                The more a recipe **exceeds** these limits, the worse it performs.

                As with nutritional scoring:
                - The **weight** you assign to each metric controls how much it affects the final score.
                - Even if a recipe is very high in CO‚ÇÇ or land use, its effect on the total score depends on **how much weight** you‚Äôve given that metric.

                > *Note: The thresholds and median values are divided by the number of preferred meals.*

                ---

                ### ‚öñÔ∏è Final Score

                The final score you see is a **combination of the health and environmental scores**.

                You can adjust the balance in the **Preferences**:

                - **Default**: 50% health, 50% environment
                - You can shift this toward **just health**, **just environment**, or anywhere in between.

                **Final Score = (Health Score √ó Health Weight) + (Environmental Score √ó Environmental Weight)**  

                ---

                #### üß† Weighting System

                You can set how important each metric is to **you** in the **Preferences** section.  
                Each metric has a default weight, and your selections apply multipliers based on the following scale:

                | Your Choice           | Multiplier |
                |------------------------|------------|
                | Default (neutral)      | 1.0        |
                | Somewhat important     | 1.25       |
                | Important              | 1.5        |
                | Very important         | 2.0        |
                | Exclude from scoring   | 0.0        |

                These weights are **normalized to sum to 1**, so the perfect possible health or environment score is also **1**.  
                To make scores easier to read, we convert them into **percentages from 0 to 100** in the app.

                ---
                ### üßÆ Default Weights Table

                Below is the list of default weights used to calculate the scores before any customization. These weights reflect the relative importance of each category in the total score:

                #### ‚öñÔ∏è Overall Score Balance

                | Component            | Default Weight (%) |

                - This setup lets you customize scoring based on your own values and health goals.

    ### üé® Color Scheme Explanation

    To help you interpret scores and values at a glance, we use a simple color coding system for nutritional and environmental metrics.

    ---

    #### ü•ó Nutritional Metrics

    Each nutrient in a recipe is compared to its **recommended daily intake** (or upper limit). Based on this comparison:

    | Color   | Meaning                         |
    |---------|---------------------------------|
    | üü© Green  | **Within** the healthy recommended range                             |
    | üüß Orange | **Close** to the recommended intake (potential deficiency or excess) |
    | üü• Red    | **Above** the recommended limit (potential excess)                   |

    This helps identify where a meal may fall short or oversupply specific nutrients.

    ---

    #### üåç Environmental Metrics

    Each environmental metric (like CO‚ÇÇ, land use, or water use) is compared to a **threshold** or **median value**. The color reflects **how far the value deviates** from what‚Äôs considered reasonable:

    | Situation       | Color                        | Description                                |
    |-----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
    | Below               | üü© Green                     | Low-impact                                 |
    | Slightly above      | üüß Orange                    | Medium-impact                              |
    | Significantly above | üü• Red                       | High-impact                                |
